# Genome-to-genome tuberculosis study associates a _FLOT1_ host regulatory allele with a recently expanded _Mtb_ clade
Code for genome-to-genome study of tuberculosis

# Abstract
Variation in the human genome may act together with pathogen genetic variation in determining tuberculosis (TB) disease outcome. We conducted a genome-to-genome (g2g) analysis of 1,556 paired human and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (_Mtb_) genomes from Peruvian TB patients. We identify a significant association between an intronic host variant (rs3130660) in the HLA class I region and an _Mtb_ variant that is exclusively carried by a subclade of the Beijing L2 lineage (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.33-1.44, P = 9.24 â¨‰ 10-15). The host allele is a _FLOT1_ expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in multiple disease-relevant cell and tissue types, suggesting _FLOT1_ may influence TB risk. The _Mtb_ variant defines an L2 subclade, which we refer to as g2g-L2, that has expanded rapidly in Peru since its introduction in the 1950s. _Ex vivo_ assays assessing F420 redox status demonstrate that g2g-L2 exists in a more oxidized state than other L2 strains. Our findings provide clear evidence that human host variation may interact with functionally different Mtb strains to affect differences in clinical outcome.
