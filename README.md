# A _FLOT1_ host regulatory allele is associated with a recently expanded _Mtb_ clade in patients with tuberculosis 
Code for the genome-to-genome study of tuberculosis

# Abstract
The outcome of infectious diseases may depend on the interaction between human and pathogen genomic variations. We explore this relationship in tuberculosis (TB) by conducting a genome-to-genome (g2g) study of paired genomes from humans and the infectious agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (_Mtb_) in 1,556 Peruvian TB patients. We identified a significant association between a human variant in the _FLOT1_ gene and a unique _Mtb_ Lineage 2 (L2) subclade. The host allele affects _FLOT1_ expression in multiple tissue and cell types including lung, the primary site of TB disease. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the _Mtb_ subclade has expanded rapidly in Peru since its emergence in the 1950s. Unbiased phenotypic profiling demonstrates that strains from the interacting _Mtb_ subclade display different redox metabolism from other L2 strains. This study presents clear evidence that human and bacterial genetic variation interact together to produce different clinical outcomes.
