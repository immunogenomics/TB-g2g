# Abstract
Variation in the human genome may act together with pathogen genetic variation in determining tuberculosis (TB) disease outcome. We conducted a genome-to-genome (g2g) analysis of 1,556 paired human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genomes from Peruvian TB patients. We identify a significant association between an intronic host variant (rs3130660) in the HLA class I region and an Mtb variant that is exclusively carried by a subclade of the Beijing L2 lineage (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.33-1.44, P = 9.24 â¨‰ 10-15). The host allele is a FLOT1 expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in multiple disease-relevant cell and tissue types, suggesting FLOT1 may influence TB risk. The Mtb variant defines an L2 subclade, which we refer to as g2g-L2, that has expanded rapidly in Peru since its introduction in the 1950s. Ex vivo assays assessing F420 redox status demonstrate that g2g-L2 exists in a more oxidized state than other L2 strains. In our household studies, we observe that g2g-L2 appears to be less transmissible than other L2 strains. Our findings provide clear evidence that human host variation may interact with functionally different Mtb strains to affect differences in clinical outcome.
